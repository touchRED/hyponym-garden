This is [hyponym garden](http://ctrotter.co/hyponym-garden/), a culture navigation tool that displays connections between linguistic forms and their associated imagery. I know that probably sounds realllly corny :/ anyway

Use the right arrow (or tap right) to move forward a synonym. Use the left arrow (or tap left) to go back. Press the space bar (or tap in the center) to inspect the images associated with the current word. To try out your own word, just click on the text, edit it, and press return.

The default seed word is "building." To link to a version with your own seed word, just insert it into the URL like so, and refresh the page:

	"http://ctrotter.co/hyponym-garden/#newword"

The "#" character is really important so watch out

Uses the GIPHY and Wordnik APIs
